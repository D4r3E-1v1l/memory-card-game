# Memory Card Game
In this step-by-step project you will learn more about JavaScript as you create a card game.

## Get started
Create a new git repository to work in, clone a local copy, and create the following 3 files:
`index.html`
`style.css`
`script.js`

Create an `images` directory, and add [this set of 9 nine images](memory-game-images.zip) (you will need to unzip this file and store the individual images in the `images` directory, otherwise you can copy them individually from [here](/step-1/images/)).

Once you have your files setup, go to [Step 1](/step-1).
